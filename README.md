# Building CNN Layers from Scratch  

This project focuses on designing and implementing **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers** from scratch using Python and NumPy. It trains the custom-built CNN on an image dataset, evaluates performance using standard metrics, and visualizes feature maps for interpretability.  

## Key Features  
- **Custom CNN Layers**: Designed and implemented layers such as **Convolutional**, **Pooling**, **Flatten**, and **Dense** from scratch without using pre-built libraries.  
- **Feature Map Visualization**: Visualized intermediate feature maps to enhance interpretability of model predictions.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.  

## Technologies  
- **Python** and **NumPy** for implementing CNN layers.  
- **TensorFlow** for dataset handling and performance comparison.  

## Results  
- **Custom Implementation**: Successfully trained and tested a CNN built entirely from scratch.  
- **Metrics**: Evaluated performance using precision, recall, and F1 score.  

## Dataset  
The model was trained on a custom image dataset.
## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amhrahat/CSE424.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash 
   cd Building-CNN-Layers-from-Scratch
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore and execute the code:
   ```bash

## Future Improvements  
- Add support for advanced CNN layers such as Dropout and Batch Normalization.  
- Implement training optimizations using custom backpropagation logic. 
- Test the CNN on larger datasets for scalability analysis.
